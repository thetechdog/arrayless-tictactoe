# Arrayless Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple command line Tic-Tac-Toe 2 player game written in C++!

# How to play
Both players must enter their names. Afterwards, each of them is going to take a turn, for up to 9 turns!
Placing X or 0 on the grid is done by inputting the coordinates as such: "line,column".
First player to reach a chain of 3 symbols wins. If 9 turns pass without a winner, then it's a draw (obviously)...
Tl;dr standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules, just make sure to follow the aforementioned structure when inputting the coordinates.
